# Hardhat Template

A repo as template to easily test, develop and compile Solidity smart contracts. This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Use NPM instead of Yarn to install dependencies:
```shell
npm i
```

```
yarn start
```
